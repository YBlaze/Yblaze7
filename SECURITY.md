# Security Policy

YBlaze7 security policy.

## Supported Versions

| Release Tag     | Supported          |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Depreciated/EOL | :x: (Not Supported, do not report vulnerabilities)                |
| Nearing EoL     | :heavy_check_mark: (Supported, report vulnerabilities) |
| Extended Date   | :heavy_check_mark: (Supported, report vulnerabilities)  |
| Supported       | :heavy_check_mark: (Supported, report vulnerabilities) |
| Newest          | :heavy_check_mark: (Supported, report vulnerabilities) |

Do not report vulnerabilities for versions that are not supported or eol. They will be ignored.
Builds normally have a eol of **one month** (except for extended date builds that have a eol of **one months**). Builds of previous generations will be depreciated by the time a new generation releases, (e.g. Alpha builds (gen0) will be depreciated when Beta builds (gen1) are released).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities in issues. Begin the issue with either Vulnerability or Security. We check our issues every Monday (GMT+11), so expect a reply on Mondays. Vulnerabilities are very serious so there is a very small chance that they will be dismissed. Expect a fix in the next builds of YBlaze7
